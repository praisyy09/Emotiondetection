## Introduction

The goal of this project is to develop an emotion detection model that can classify facial expressions into distinct categories. This can be useful in various applications, including customer service, mental health monitoring, and user experience improvement.

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you set up the project on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Dataset

The dataset used for training the model contains facial images organized into directories based on emotions. The directory structure is as follows:

/content/archive/
    ├── train/
    │   ├── Angry/
    │   ├── Disgust/
    │   ├── Fear/
    │   ├── Happy/
    │   ├── Sad/
    │   ├── Surprise/
    │   └── Neutral/
    └── test/
        ├── Angry/
        ├── Disgust/
        ├── Fear/
        ├── Happy/
        ├── Sad/
        ├── Surprise/
        └── Neutral/



### Installation

To run this project, you need to install the following dependencies:

1. **Python 3.7 or later**
2. **TensorFlow**: 
   ```bash
   pip install tensorflow
Usage
Clone the repository or download the code files.
Place the dataset in the correct directory structure as mentioned above.
Open a Jupyter notebook or a Python script to run the code.


Training the Model
To train the model, run the provided code. It will:
Load the dataset from the specified directories.
Augment the training images for better generalization.
Build a convolutional neural network (CNN) model using MobileNet.
Train the model using the training dataset while validating it with the test dataset.
The training process includes early stopping to prevent overfitting and model checkpointing to save the best-performing model.
