## Introduction

The goal of this project is to develop an emotion detection model that can classify facial expressions into distinct categories. This can be useful in various applications, including customer service, mental health monitoring, and user experience improvement.

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you set up the project on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

## Model Architecture
The model architecture consists of the following key components:

**Base Model**: The model uses MobileNet as the base for feature extraction. MobileNet is a lightweight deep learning architecture that is optimized for mobile devices, providing a good balance between speed and accuracy.

**Input Shape**: The input shape is set to (224, 224, 3), corresponding to RGB images of size 224x224 pixels.
Flatten Layer: The output of the MobileNet base is flattened to convert the 2D feature maps into a 1D vector, which is necessary for feeding into the dense layers.

**Dense Layer**: The flattened output is then passed to a dense layer with a softmax activation function. The number of units in this layer corresponds to the number of emotion classes (e.g., Angry, Disgust, Fear, Happy, Sad, Surprise, Neutral).

**Compilation**: The model is compiled using the Adam optimizer and categorical crossentropy loss function, suitable for multi-class classification tasks.
